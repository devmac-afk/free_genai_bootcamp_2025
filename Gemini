4.  **Structured Guidance:** We'll present a sentence structure with blanks for you to fill, like a template.
5.  **Interactive Analysis:** We'll offer prompts and questions to guide your thought process, making the learning more engaging.
6.  **Solution (After you try!):** Only after you've attempted the translation will we reveal the complete Sanskrit sentence, Romanized transliteration (IAST) in a table format, and a detailed explanation.

**Let's begin!**

**Step 1: Your Sentence**

Please enter the English sentence you would like to translate into Sanskrit:

**(User Input Here)**

**(After the user provides a sentence, continue with the following.  Example using "The children are playing with toys.")**
---

**Example User Sentence:** The children are playing with toys.

**Step 2: Identify Key Words (Root Words)**

*   Children → बालक (bālaka) (plural: बालकाः bālakāḥ)
*   Play → क्रीड् (krīḍ) (root verb - to play)
*   With → सह (saha) (or using instrumental case)
*   Toys → क्रीडनक (krīḍanaka) (plural: क्रीडनकानि krīḍanakāni)

**Step 3: Grammar Breakdown**

*   Subject (Nominative Case, Plural, Masculine) → बालकाः (bālakāḥ)
*   Preposition (Instrumental Case, Plural, Neuter) → क्रीडनकैः (krīḍanakaiḥ) (using instrumental with "with")
*   Verb (Third-Person Plural, Present Tense) → क्रीडन्ति (krīḍanti)

**Step 4: Sentence Structure (Fill in the Blanks)**

___ (Nominative, Plural, Masculine) ___ (Instrumental, Plural, Neuter) ___ (Verb, Third Person Plural, Present Tense).

**Step 5: Guide for Analysis (Interactive Prompts)**

*   **For the Noun "Children":** "बालक" is masculine.  You have the plural form "बालकाः". Is this already in the correct nominative plural form?
*   **For the Noun "Toys":** "क्रीडनक" is neuter.  Since they are used "with" which case is appropriate? (Hint: Instrumental case). What will be the plural form of क्रीडनक?
*   **For the Verb "Play":** The root verb is "क्रीड्". We need the third-person *plural* present tense form. Do you remember the rules for conjugating verbs in the present tense (लट् लकार)?  How does the verb ending change for a *plural* subject?
*   **Word Order:** Sanskrit generally follows Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) order.  Place the words in the correct sequence. The preposition "सह" can come before or after the instrumental noun.

**Think carefully and try to fill in the blanks. Don't worry if you make mistakes – that's how we learn! Once you've given it your best shot, reveal the solution below.**
